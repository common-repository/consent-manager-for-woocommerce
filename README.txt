The plugin is for the capture of consent data for adults and children. It integrates with WooCommerce so that consent details can be easily captured.


== Description ==

This plugin allows you to manage customer consent and associated personal data. It is especially useful for organisations that need to obtain consent from parents and adults. Currently it allows for managing medical information, contact information and permissions to use customer photos and other media.

Consent Manager is also used for managing GDPR compliance. It provides a single point where the organisations policies with regards to storing and managing customer information can be managed.
